<h1>Accessibility plugin</h1>
<p>Accessibility plugin is designed to help visually impaired people use OsmAnd.</p>
<p>To use it, you need to turn the accessibility talkback option in the settings of your phone. Then enter OsmAnd. To enable the Accessibility plugin, you'll have to enter the Plugins menu - Accessibility - Enable. Please note that you can choose when to use the plugin in Plugins menu - Accessibility - Settings. There, you'll also be able to turn on other options (using the trackball for zoom control, etc). You'll also be able to set speech rate there.
As you tap the elements of the interface, you'll hear their names. To move the map, use two fingers (this can depend on your phone's accessibility settings).</p>

<p>Since version 2.3, OsmAnd has the option allowing you to tap a location on the map and get the address of that location. To do that in accessibility mode, you'll need to go to the main menu and tap Use location, then tap on the context menu to hear the address. Also, if you tap the map, you'll get information about the distance to the next waypoint or to the destination point.</p>
